A man who filed a fake lawsuit against Gov. Chris Christie, as well as a New Jersey state senator he lost to in 2012, is now arguing that his actions did not justify the governor's tax cut.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has signed into law a tax cut in the state's most expensive state budget years.
