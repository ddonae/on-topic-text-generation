A flight"," -- Colgan Air, a regional airline, faces a nearly $1.9 million fine after it allegedly allowed 84 flight attendants to fly for a week after the airline was informed they had been trained on fire extinguishers that were different from those used on their aircraft.

The alleged infraction occurred in November of 2009, at a time the airline was under additional scrutiny because of a fatal crash of a Colgan Air jet near Buffalo, New York, nine months earlier. But it was unclear whether it was the additional scrutiny, or a routine inspection, that led to the discovery about the improper training.
