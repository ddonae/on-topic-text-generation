That disclosure on Tuesday illuminated congressional dismay with the White House over its decision to finally negotiate Bergdahl's release in exchange for the transfer of five men held at Guantanamo Bay to Qatar.

A statement by House Speaker John Boehner referred to ""serious questions"" he and others raised in briefings that date back as far as late 2011 and in followup correspondence, and said promises of further discussions were ignored.
